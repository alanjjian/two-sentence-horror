# December 2022 Contest Prompt

We did the whole Christmas theme last year or the year before or the year before. Who knows? Don't you feel like you do the same thing over and over with no escape? Let's celebrate that existential crisis! 

The theme this month is ""**escape**"". Stories must begin with \[DEC22\] and contain a variation of the word **escape** (e.g., escaping, escaped, etc.)

Properly formatted contest December 2022 examples:

&gt;\[DEC22\] I'll never escape. This is my second sentence.  
\[Dec22\] This may be my first sentence. I escaped getting banned.

Improperly formatted contest November 2022 examples:

&gt;\[Dec2022\] The tag is not correct. I can't escape my inability to follow rules.  
In \[DEC22\], I got the tag right, but it's not at the beginning. I also don't mention the theme at all.

**December Contest Rules**

* The top 10 highest-voted stories will be the winners!
* Winners can only place in the top 10 once. The highest of the entries will be their winner.
* Only net new stories will be allowed (no repurposing old stories you've previously submitted).
* Submissions  that are improperly formatted, do not fit the theme, or break any of  the existing sub rules will be disqualified and removed.
   * Max three stories per day as a general rule, and all three can be used towards the contest.
* Entries  that are edited after submission may be disqualified. If you edit it to  fix a typo, that should be fine; if you edit to fix formatting,  language, or plot, it is up to the mod's discretion to remove.
* Winners  will be decided by total community upvotes. In the unlikely event of a  tie for the top spots, moderators will vote for a tiebreaker.

**WINNERS WILL RECEIVE:**

*1st, 2nd, and 3rd Places*:  You receive a custom personal flair of your choosing to show off to the  2SH community! (If you're a repeat winner, you can modify your  flair.... but that's it.) And a cool fancy flair on your winning  stories.

*7 honorable mentions*: Story links will be featured on next month’s announcement!

*Contest ends on December 31, 2022 @ 11:59pm (GMT)*
