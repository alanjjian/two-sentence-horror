55,FEBRUARY ANNOUNCEMENT + JANUARY WINNERS,"Hello again, faithful followers! You all kicked off 2023 with a series of horrifying stories featuring liars, betrayals, and monsters of the two-faced variety. I have come once again, your ~~worshipful cult leader~~ subreddit moderator, to announce the winners of last months contest and reveal the theme for the new month!

But first, a few announcements and reminders...

## ANNOUNCEMENTS

* If you see something, say something! If you see a post that you think breaks the rules, don't just make a comment and hope that the mods get to it; report it! It's the only way to guarantee that a moderator puts eyes on the story.
* Oppression (racism, transphobia, homophobia, etc), while horrifying, is starting to become an overused trope, so if you decide to use it in your story, make sure it's especially unique.
* While we understand the temptation to use ChatGPT, one of our rules is that the stories you submit must be written by *you*. If we find you've been using it to generate stories, the posts will be removed under Rule 5: Be Original.
* Don't troll or spam, don't be a jerk, don't plagiarize, and don't intentionally post stories that are low quality/low effort! All of these things may result in a permaban! Read up on our [Three Strikes and you're out rule](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoSentenceHorror/wiki/rules/#wiki_red_dot_warnings.3A) (note, plagiarism is a once-and-you-are-permabanned ban!)

## FEBRUARY 2023 Contest Prompt

&gt;""The rules of fair play do not apply in love and war."" - *Euphues* by John Lyly

February is known as the month of love. It's the month where Cupid comes down from the heavens and strikes love into the hearts of his victims. Sometimes, however, those he strikes are already in relationships, and in their partners we find not love...but murder. After all, *all's fair in love and war.*

The theme for this month is ""**love and war**"". Stories must begin with \[FEB23\] and contain **either** the word **love** or the word **war**. There are no bonus points for using both, but know that I, personally, will be impressed.

Properly formatted February 2023 examples:

&gt;\[FEB23\] ""I love killing,"" said the murderer. This is the second sentence.   
&gt;  
&gt;\[Feb23\] War? War never changes.

Improperly formatted examples:

&gt;\[February2023\] This tag isn't right. I love contests though.   
&gt;  
&gt;In \[Feb23\], I got the tag right, but it's not at the beginning. I also didn't mention the theme at all.

**February Contest Rules**

* The top 10 highest-voted stories will be the winners!
* Winners can only place in the top 10 once. The highest of the entries will be their winner.
* Only net new stories will be allowed (no repurposing old stories you've previously submitted).
* Submissions that are improperly formatted, do not fit the theme, or break any of the existing sub rules will be disqualified and removed.
   * Max three stories per day as a general rule, and all three can be used towards the contest.
* Entries that are edited after submission may be disqualified. If you edit it to fix a typo, that should be fine; if you edit to fix formatting, language, or plot, it is up to the mod's discretion to remove.
* Winners will be decided by total community upvotes. In the unlikely event of a tie for the top spots, moderators will vote for a tiebreaker.

**WINNERS WILL RECEIVE:**

* 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Places: You receive a custom personal flair of your choosing to show off to the TSH community! (If you're a repeat winner, you can modify your flair.... but that's it.) And a cool fancy flair on your winning stories.
* 7 honorable mentions: Story links will be featured on next month’s announcement!

Contest ends on February 28, 2023 @ 11:59pm (GMT)

3824,The Painting,"The Painting


The painting was strange, to say the least. It hung in the attic of the old mansion, where no one had gone for years. But when Jenna and her friends found it, they were instantly captivated.

It was a portrait of a woman, dressed in an old-fashioned gown, with a wide-brimmed hat and a stern expression. Her eyes seemed to follow Jenna and her friends as they walked around the room.

As the days went by, Jenna couldn't shake the feeling that the painting was somehow alive. She couldn't explain it, but every time she looked at it, she felt a chill run down her spine.

One night, Jenna woke up to find the painting in her room. She tried to scream, but no sound came out. The woman in the painting started to move, her mouth opening as if to speak.

Jenna was paralyzed with fear. She couldn't move, couldn't scream, couldn't do anything. The woman stepped out of the painting and started to walk towards her.

Suddenly, Jenna was transported to a different time and place. She was in the same mansion, but everything was different. The walls were stained with blood, and the air was thick with the scent of death.
The woman from the painting was there, standing in front of Jenna. Her eyes were empty, and she didn't speak. She just stared at Jenna with a cold, unfeeling gaze.

Jenna tried to run, but she couldn't move. The woman started to walk towards her, her steps slow and deliberate.

Just as the woman was about to touch Jenna, she woke up. She was back in her own bed, in her own room. But the painting was still there, staring at her with those empty eyes.

Jenna knew she had to get rid of the painting. She called a friend to help her, and they took it to a thrift store to donate it.

But as Jenna was leaving the store, she saw something that made her blood run cold. The woman from the painting was standing outside, staring at her with those same cold, unfeeling eyes.

From that day on, Jenna never saw the painting again. But she knew that it was still out there, waiting for its next victim to come along."
